Practical Aassignment for Computer Vision course at LUT

Student: Lukoshkin Aleksandr 

Supervisor: Arto Kaarna

This work is a practical assignment for the Computer Vision course. The task is to develop a robotic system to solve a problem of recovering 3D scene from 2D image. The basic hardware consist of a computer, camera (Kinect), robot with a gripper and four blocks with different color. The current task for this work â€“ make a stack of these blocks. This work can be divided on next steps:

1. Calibration task (to find a matrix M for transformation between coordinate planes)
2. Recovery task (to find 3D real-world coordinates from image coordinates)
3. Robot control task
